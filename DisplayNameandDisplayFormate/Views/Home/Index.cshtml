@model IEnumerable<DisplayNameandDisplayFormate.Models.tblEmployee>
@foreach (var item in Model)

@Html.Partial("_employee", item)
    { Html.RenderPartial("_employee", item);}//render partial is better in performance 
    //becuase it it render the view directly to output stream we use partial in such
    //cases when we want to want to store viewe in variable and then change it
